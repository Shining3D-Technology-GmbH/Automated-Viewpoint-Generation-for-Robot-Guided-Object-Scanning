# Automated-Viewpoint-Generation-for-Robot-Guided-Object-Scanning
This repository offers a solution for generating optimal scanner view paths using CAD models in robotic systems. By establishing a reusable relationship between an object’s geometry and the robot's scanning positions, the system dynamically adjusts viewpoints based on the object’s orientation, ensuring accurate surface scanning.
Key Features:
CAD Model Integration: Imports CAD files to extract geometric data for the object.
Dynamic Viewpoint Calculation: Calculates optimal scanner viewpoints that adapt to changes in object position and orientation.
Reusable Viewpoint Logic: Once established, the relationship can be applied repeatedly across different orientations of the same object.
Efficient Path Generation: Uses inverse kinematics to compute precise robot movements for accurate scanning.
Real-Time Adjustments: Automatically adjusts scanning viewpoints in real-time as objects move.
Use Cases:
Ideal for industrial automation, robotic inspection, and dynamic environments requiring precise, adaptable scanning.
