# Automated-Viewpoint-Generation-for-Robot-Guided-Object-Scanning
This repository offers a solution for generating optimal scanner view paths using CAD models in robotic systems. By establishing a reusable relationship between an object’s geometry and the robot's scanning positions, the system dynamically adjusts viewpoints based on the object’s orientation, ensuring accurate surface scanning.
